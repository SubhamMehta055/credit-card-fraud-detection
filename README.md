# Credit Card Fraud Detection: End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end credit card fraud detection system built using machine learning techniques. The goal of the project is to identify fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data, helping financial institutions reduce losses due to fraud. The system leverages various machine learning models to deliver accurate predictions while addressing the challenge of imbalanced datasets.

## Introduction
With the rise of digital transactions, credit card fraud has become a critical issue for financial institutions worldwide. Fraud detection systems are essential to identify and prevent fraudulent activities in real-time. In this project, we implement a credit card fraud detection model using multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

We also incorporate techniques to handle imbalanced classes effectively.

## Understanding Fraud Detection
Fraud detection systems analyze patterns in transaction data to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. Effective fraud detection systems must balance accuracy with the ability to detect rare fraud events, often requiring specialized techniques to handle imbalanced datasets.

## Building the Fraud Detection System
The project begins with data preprocessing, including cleaning and normalizing the dataset, which contains features generated from PCA along with transaction amounts. We implement a series of models to classify transactions, starting with **Logistic Regression** as a baseline, then moving to **Random Forest**, and finally optimizing the model using **XGBoost**. We employ **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address class imbalance, ensuring robust prediction capability.

## Project Highlights

### Fraud Detection Models Implemented
- **Logistic Regression**: Serves as a baseline model for interpretability and performance comparison.
- **Random Forest**: Enhances predictive accuracy and offers feature importance insights.
- **XGBoost**: Fine-tuned model that maximizes performance while handling imbalanced classes.

### Imbalance Handling
- Utilizes techniques like **SMOTE** and class weights to improve model effectiveness.

### Evaluation Metrics
- Assesses model performance using **F1-Score**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **ROC-AUC** metrics.

## Dataset Description
The project uses the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains:

- **Features**: 30 anonymized features resulting from PCA, the transaction amount, and a target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (Class).
- **Class Distribution**: Highly imbalanced with only a small percentage of transactions classified as fraudulent.

## Key Functionalities

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- Cleaned and normalized transaction data.
- Handled missing values and scaled features appropriately.

### Fraud Detection Models
- **Logistic Regression**: Established a baseline for the model's predictive capabilities.
- **Random Forest**: Implemented to improve accuracy and analyze feature importance.
- **XGBoost**: Optimized model designed for efficiency in prediction, particularly in imbalanced scenarios.

### Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using metrics such as **F1-Score**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **ROC-AUC** to ensure robustness in model performance.

### Imbalance Handling Techniques
- Implemented **SMOTE** to oversample the minority class, enhancing the model's ability to detect fraud.
- Adjusted class weights to give more importance to the minority class during training.
